\begin{center}BookIT - ITU Booking System\end{center}

The IT-University of Copenhagen has been considering making an integrated system for booking of rooms. The current process for booking rooms is spread over multiple systems and is not very manageable. The primary goal of the integrated system is to relieve the workload of Facility Management and reduce the number of errors in booking when bookings are handled.
\\The aim of this project was to develop a booking system for the IT-University of Copenhagen based on a specification of software requirements.
\\The result of this project is a first functional release consisting of a service and a client. This first release supports booking of rooms, equipment and catering for internal users. It does not support external users and resource use statistics.
\\The list of defects and other issues consists of a better testing strategy, support for more tasks and usability tests amongst other things.
\\A comparison to commercial systems showed that there were no available commercial systems that satisfy all of the needs of the IT-University of Copenhagen.
